# Class Questions #

Here are the student submitted questions and my answers to them - I was unable to present this in class. I hope my presentation answered some of these and where appropriate I may say as much to avoid making this a book. 
Answers are in ___bold italics___ with my initials "JDT". 

Note, where "cloud engineering" is used I will likely be more generic and just call it "information technology" as cloud engineering has only been part of my career for about 3.5 years.

## Career

1. What are the bare minimum GitHub skills everyone needs to know?

   JDT: ___I can't emphasize enough how Soure Code management is one of, if not the, most important skills for you to pick up on in your classes or on the side. 
   With the exception of coding out of your basement (and even then it can be argued you would still want to use git) most software is developed in a team using
   very controlled process. "git" is the de-facto tool for managing source code and github.com is one of the most popular cloud-based implementations of git for organizational
   collboration and management. It is not the only source code management tool but knowing git/github will  allow you to transfer these skills elsewhere.___
   ___For minimum
   skills I suggest being able to create your own repo, being able to clone, push, pull, create branches, merge, etc., being able to open a pull request,
   and understanding the difference
   between gitflow and trunk-based development. Thrivent relies heavily on GitHub Actions for CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) and would be a more
   advanced thing to learn but will IMHO make you very appealing to an interviewer.___

   ___Be sure to take advantage of your student status to enroll in [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education). You can get access to more AI tokens this way!___

3. What are some not commonly taught skills you think students should learn?
   What skills do you think are most important for someone interested in building a
   career in cloud computing? From your experience, what are the most important
   skills or knowledge areas for someone beginning a career in cloud computing to
   focus on? If you were starting your career today, what tools, certifications, or
   learning paths would you prioritize to be competitive in the cloud industry?
   Based on your industry experience, what technical and soft skills do you think are
   most valuable for students entering the cloud computing or DevOps field today?

   JDT: ___What frustrates me about where things are in CS now is since I was a student we have abstracted away so much important critical information about the basic operating of a computer. I think
   many students have no idea where a file they are working with really is and the difference of a local file (on your device's hard drive) vs a shared network drive (OneDrive, etc) or directly synced to a cloud
   provider. Teaching new people how to run commands on a remote system is also something that I struggle with. This also applies to where a program is actually running, is it on your local CPU or is it remote and you
   are just seeing the output. On the complete opposite end of the pendulum I think it would be great if students were formally introduced to the cloud in their curriculum.
   I think your courseware is still important tho as the primary resource you need to develop at this stage is critical thinking skills. It's had to suggest any one skill or knowledge area to help you start your career. I think
   most places want to see some real work so any kind of internship or summer work related to IT will help a lot. It's hard to recommend certifications at this stage as most are expecting some minimum level of experience in the
   job market to pass. And there have been a rash of people finding ways to fake certifications or cheat on them. That said if it helps you to learn something I think it's still valuable. For soft skills anything you can add
   about working in a team setting is valuable for an interview. In my experience just being yourself is the best soft skill, if you go into an interview and they don't like who you are, it wasn't meant to be and there are
   better options for you...___

   ___Automation is a skill I wish was taught more to students as well, companies are always looking for ways to reduce repeated simple menial tasks so engineers can focus on the
   more difficult stuff.___

4. What was the job that got you into cloud computing? How did you get into cloud
computing, what was your career path like? What would be the first steps you
would take to enter a career similar to yours?

   JDT: ___As mentioned in presentation I got lucky with cloud, I was given a position I had no experience but it was because the leadership at Thrivent knew I was capable and could learn and apply quickly. Sometimes it's good
   to know people, but the bottom line is you have to be good at your job to get this kind of trust, and that takes time. To get started, the first steps are to work hard and learn as much as you can. Being complacent will likely
   eventually get you replaced with someone who moves faster or by AI...___

5. After your experience, what skills do you wish you'd improved at our stage or
would develop knowing what you know now. IE coming out of school into the
workforce?

   JDT: ___I think the expectation coming out of school is that you will not know everything there is to know, so I wouldn't focus a ton on this. THAT SAID, I highly encourange you to find an area of IT that interests you and
   to try to learn more about it outside of your classwork, try to build something real with it, try to see if you really like it, because work is a long part of your future.
   This helps you understand if this is something you feel you can do every day, and gives you something to talk about in an interview if you are having
   trouble getting other kinds of experience.___

6. Would you recommend students pursuing industry certifications? Or should that
be something to develop on a job to job basis? Such as things like Security+, or
AWS online certifications.

   JDT: ___I have gone back and forth on certs, some times it is the only way to prove you know something because of the catch-22 where it can be tough get a job in something without experience and you can't get
   experience without getting a job. It can help you to get a first round interview but I don't know that it helps much past that. That said, after you have 5-10 years of experience I think certs become more valuable
   as it demonstrates proficiency in addition to real world experience and many certs are known to be difficult to attain. Memorization can only go so far. I never think a cert is a bad thing.___

7. What is your perception of the overall direction of the tech job market? Are
students coming out less prepared mentally but, more efficient in small things
due to AI?

   JDT: ___I don't have a great answer to this one unfortunately. Most of my entire org (4-5 teams that I work with, 30 people total) are all over 30 years old. I haven't worked with many new students especially at my last 
   job. I think there's a perception that new students are not as prepared to contribute quickly to a large IT shop, but I don't know that it's entirely the student's fault as the amount of layers we have put on building code
   now simply means there's too much to learn and too much for your instructors to teach. I think the overall direction of tech jobs though is that they are not going away and I think there will be plenty of opprotunity - I will 
   discuss more in the AI section...___

8. What would be your advice to set our applications apart in situations where
maybe an individual student doesn't have networking connections to leverage
into an entry level job or an internship?

   JDT: ___I would write your application with a sense of enthusiasm and excitement regardless of your experience. I would target a handful of companies and learn their tech stack as best you can, you may have to get creative
   to figure this out but some times you can reach out via LinkedIn. I would always tailor your application to the company you are applying to and especially to the position you are applying to, do not use the same application 
   for each job posting. Learn about the company, their core values, their CEO name, etc. Prove that you are legitimately interested in working there. Simple things that can go a long ways to at least getting you a first look.
   LinkedIn is an expected social media tool for job hunters, make your profile as complete as possible and be professional. Don't be afraid to pay for services to help, even a simple professional photo can go a long ways.___

9. In your experience as a professor [sic], what are the most common/biggest
pitfalls in computer science education? Both from a student perspective and what
professors commonly harm students by doing/not doing?

   JDT: ___This is a tough one, I have been an adjunct professor but for adult learners, and non-major students. I think computer science professors have a difficult job of really trying to stay current, especially today. I 
   hope your CS professors are building relationships with local industry to learn what their needs are from the graduating students they have hired, if they are not doing that I would question them. I don't think any "harm" is 
   intentional as professors are also working for a living and are often overloaded due to declining enrollment. I think there's a tendancy for professors to get complacent and want to teach the same material year after year 
   instead of updating it for modern situations, but there are many that actively work against that tendancy.___

10. What do you wish you had known before starting in cloud computing?

    JDT: ___More about the cloud! :)  That said I still struggle with how core networking works in the cloud. I wish before starting out I had a better understanding of infrastructure as code and about "serverless" tech
    such as Event Driven Architecture.___

11. What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just starting out in tech?

    JDT: ___Stay in shape. This probably is unexpected but after 30 years in tech and sitting in a chair for the better part of my career, you need to take care of your body just as much as your mind. It's easy to plan to 
    take a lunch walk and instead find yourself so bogged down in work that instead of going for a walk, or even eating lunch, that you just work right through it. Also when you start a full-time job you are often mentally 
    exhausted after working and the last thing you want to do after work is, well, anything at all. It's easy to sit in a chair and doom scroll for an hour. This is true of many office jobs, but I think it's really a problem
    with engineering IT fields that are very demanding on you mentally.___

## Daily Work

1. What's your favorite part of your job? What do you enjoy most about your work?

   JDT: ___I enjoy when I have a new problem, and I have a good idea how to solve it but I know it will be challenging, and I actually have the time on my calendar day to dive into it uninterrupted. And if I
   can solve this problem, especially if my theory on how to solve it was correct, I feel great. It is really a nice feeling to end a work day knowing you put your mind to work on something and you had the skills
   to fix it. These days are unfortunately not as often as I would hope but usually that's the result of a busy calendar full of meetings or when my theory is wrong, but I don't mind too much when that happens as
   it just means there is a different solution to figure out.___

2. Out of all the projects you've done, what was the one you learned the most from?
What’s one project or experience that really taught you something in your
career?

   JDT: ___In my current job I think I learned the most from my previous mentor who was bound and determined to help me get aclimated to cloud. I wrote a few fairly complicated scripts in particular that he was
   impressed with for determining if certain resources were in use across our entire cloud deployment and could be targetted for decom (therefore saving the company precious $$$). I go back to that silly Excel macro
   I wrote for that person in the Legal team at Bankers Systems. She had struggled with this for months and asked for help and someone finally helped her and she championed me at that company every chance she got, I
   learned from that how important it is to raise your hand and help someone out.___

3. How do you stay current with the pace of tech changes in cloud computing and
any similar fields? How do you keep up with all the new changes in tech?

   JDT: ___I honestly can't. I rely on others for this. When the work day is over I try to avoid work related stuff. I think this is the result of my age, I just don't have the energy to start looking at tech articles.
   That said, we have some people on my team that love to research new tech and keep on top of changes and they are willing to share. I have learned a lot from them. So I guess I proxy that...___

4. How much of your work is independent versus part of a team?

   JDT: ___All code I submit is supposed to follow the PR ("Peer Review") process where someone else reviews it. That said, on my team we have some trust built amoungst coworkers who trust that we know what we are doing and a
   Peer Review amounts to a quick glance and rubber stamp of approval. So I do get some independent work time, but I was say 60-70% of the work I do is collaborative to a degree. I am trying to also train in a new contractor
   so my supervisor has asked me to take on more of a mentoring role in the team.___

5. What kinds of projects do you typically work on during a normal workday?

   JDT: ___Today, it's a lot of support work, we have an old product that is nearing the end of its life and due to staff turnover in the last year I am the SME (Subject Matter Expert) in it so I tend to have to do a lot
   of question answering and meetings. I am trying to train up the rest of my team to share the load. When I'm coding it's largely Infrastructure as Code for the cloud using `terraform` so I am often writing small snippets of
   terraform code to slightly change our cloud environment. I am also working on shared GitHub actions workflows that others use to run their own terraform but in a much more controlled environment.___

6. Can you describe a real-world challenge you’ve encountered while working with
cloud infrastructure, and how you or your team solved it? What is the most
difficult scenario you have dealt with and how did you resolve it?

   JDT: ___I think the most recent real challenge I had was to prove that our AWS networking architecture was set up correctly when working with an external vendor for Thrivent's new bank that will be public next year. The 
   bank is the biggest initiative and is high visibility, high priority, and high stress. When attempting to connect to a 3rd party vendor outside Thrivent via AWS to AWS connectivity called "PrivateLink" (similar to VPN) we 
   were getting failed connections and I was convinced the problem was on the vendor's side. I worked hours and hours to find every snippet of proof I could that our AWS cloud was set up correctly. Multiple meetings with the 
   vendor led to difficult discussions. In the end unfortunately we discovered the problem was INDEED on our AWS cloud and not the vendors. It was a learning experience that even though I thought I had everything figured out
   that I still could miss something, the problem was literally that one number in a firewall was incorrect...___

## AI

1. How has Agentic coding changed your day-to-day work life?

   JDT: ___Turned it completely upside-down. Firstly I highly recommend everyone read this article: https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-death-of-the-stubborn-developer-b5e8f78d326b
  I went from never using AI to relying upon it almost daily. I find myself using claude tokens for the simplest tasks as it's eaiser to just type out "change all print commands to echo" than it is to
   use search and replace. AI is like a drug, you get addicted quickly and you can't handle it when the drug is unavailable. When there are network issues with your LLM or when you run out of premium tokens you can feel anxious and frustrated. And you know you should cut back or quit but you just can't! :)___

   ___The term now for what we are seeing more seems to be "vibe coding" where you almost write no actual code yourself: "Vibe coding is a software development approach where an AI generates code from natural language prompts, allowing users to build applications through conversation rather than manual typing".
   I laughed when I originally heard the term but I find myself doing this more and more. That said, I have tried to take a step back and write code without the use of AI just to make sure my brain doesn't turn to jello.___

   ___Many people are completely trusting AI generated code and quickly reviewing it and merging it into their production code. One of the teams I work with relies almost completely on AI generated code. 
   This is creating a huge amount of what is called "technical AI debt". This is all code that seems to work for a while, but it will eventually have bugs creep up, security issues, or will have to be maintained by someone who
   is not the original author but now there
   is yet another additional layer of abstraction in that the auther themselves was not the author but a prompter to Copilot or whatever AI tool was used. When that person is no longer with the company this kind of code will be extremely
   hard for those left to maintain and understand.___

   ___One of the reasons I do not think this is as bad for Junior engineers as the doom-and-gloom people foretell is that even though senior engineers are expected to be 25% more effective at coding with chat oriented programming, what has happened is our work backlog has suddenly also increased by 50%. The bottom line is there will always be work for those willing to learn the most effective ways to program.___

3. How has AI changed the job market for junior engineers?

   JDT: ___I think Junior Engineers are now expected to know something about AI and coding with an AI assistant, but this expection needs to be tempered with the understanding that Jr Engineers don't have the experience to know
   when AI is giving you a pile of garbage. There is a lot of fear about AI replacing engineers but I don't think that will happen, I don't think it CAN happen. Writing code can be done by AI but there still needs to be an
   engineer in the process to direct it and to know when you're getting slop. As a new CS grad I encourage you to embrace AI as it is expected and it does help but also to continue to learn outside of AI to better your understanding
   of what AI is telling you. Prompt AI to teach you when you don't understand and don't be afraid to be skeptical.___

   ___I still know a lot of senior engineers at Thrivent who are resistant to AI, and I know a lot of former coworkers who feel similar, one so far as saying he will NEVER use AI for
   anything. These people, while they are good people and commendable in sticking to their beliefs, tend to become expendable when the company is given the direction to look into
   integrating AI. As a Junior Engineer I would be surprised if you get hired for a job with this attitude over another Junior Engineer who embraces AI and attempts to learn as much
   as they can about it.___

   ___As mentioned in the presentation, a lot of people know how to prompt AI, but a lot of people don't understand how it works (myself included). I think this generation of CS
   student can stand out by trying to understand the nuts and bolts of what happens when you type those prompts, and use that knowledge to help companies effectively use AI to
   work with their private data. The other option for Junior Engineers is to figure out how to invent something amazing using AI and hopefully turn that into profit!___

4. How does the growing use of AI affect your industry?

   JDT: ___For us, the financial industry is a large target for AI use, Thrivent is still trying to figure out how best to integrate AI with its private data. We have an entire team dedicated to this effort. That said I do
   not have a ton of insight into what will happen next.___

5. How do you think AI is changing the way people use the cloud?

   JDT: ___I will be going to the AWS re:Invent conference in early December, one of the largest tech conferences in the world, and I expect 80% of the content to be AI focused. Cloud and AI are a good match becuase most LLMs
   interact with some kind of cloud service. All the major cloud vendors are trying to offer a front end to seamlessly integrating AI in cloud native applications in hopes you will choose them and therefore pay them more $$$.___

## Cloud

1. How have you seen cloud computing change over the years, and where do you
think it’s heading? What do you see as the biggest shift in cloud computing over
the past few years, and where do you think the industry is headed in the next 3-5
years? How do you see cloud computing evolving in the next few years,
especially with the rise of AI and edge computing? How has cloud engineering
evolve over time?

   JDT: ___Only having been in the field even at an introductory level the biggest change has of course been clouds marriage with AI and I expect that to continue to be the driving force behind the next years of cloud
   development. I wish I had more to offer to this question but I'm still so new to cloud myself that I have a hard time predicting. Quantum computing is getting interesting to watch out for now...___

2. What do you think is the best way for someone new to start learning about cloud
computing?

   JDT: ___Get a free AWS account! https://aws.amazon.com/free/ The best way to start learning about cloud computing in my opinion is to literally dive in and see what you can do. Almost every area of IT has a service in AWS.
   If you are into relational databases, you can deploy about 5 different ones in the cloud, if you want to learn more about serverless coding look into Lambda, etc.___

3. What's the difference between cloud engineering and software engineering?

   JDT: ___What a great question, and one I will struggle with as I don't know in my 30 years that I have every TRUELY been a software engineer! I have had many hats but real formal software development is not really one of them, I
   view myself more as a contributor to software projects and more of an administrator/operator that happens to write code now and then. That said, software engineering to me should have a more platform agnostic viewpoint where
   it really does not matter to the engineer if the software will run in the cloud, on a phone, in a data center, on a laptop, etc. But a cloud engineer (that is developing software) has a focus on optimatizing the software to
   take advantage of cloud offerings. For example, when our team built a bot that interacted with a popular work chat tool called Slack (similar to Discord) we started by building a python script that ran all the time on a
   dedicated EC2 instance - this is similar to an always on computer in a data center. This did not take advantage of cloud tech, we eventually converted to using serverless architecture where a user issued a slack command
   which was received by a small container serivce which put a record into a database, the database triggered an event which then triggered other serverless functions to run. This took advantage of cloud native architecture and
   was much cheaper to build because it didn't require 24/7 server-based compute.___

4. What are some interesting uses of cloud computing that you can think of?

   JDT: ___The exmaple above is a good use, cloud is great for Event Driven applications (I am specifically thinking AWS but I would be surprised if the other major vendors could not support this). Cloud is great for simply not
   having to worry about paying a facility to host your server. Cloud (AWS in particular) offers hundreds of different managed services so if you can think of something interesting there's a good chance you can do it in the cloud.
   I personally think serverless applications using what's called "Step Functions" in AWS is one of the most interesting, you can make API calls using a workflow builder and essentially create a "no-code" application.___

5. Do you think most people really understand what cloud computing is?

   JDT: ___No I think a lot of people struggle with cloud computing yet, even within our own org. There's a lot to learn so I guess it's expected, it's also difficult to do cloud correctly and people go back to just doing
   what they did in the data center, but using cloud resources. We are constantly trying to educate our users on how to build "for the cloud".___

6. What do you think are the biggest challenges companies face when migrating
their systems to the cloud?

   JDT: ___Migrations are always painful. It's hard to justify the potential downtime and it's usually a difficult thing to coordinate amoung many teams. Often times what needs to be migrated is so old no one that built the original
   system is even around any more. We are struggling currently because we are trying to move from a shared account structure where all users deploy to the same cloud accounts, one for Dev, one for Prod, etc. To every team having
   their own cloud account. We can't even do this migration because to move resources from one AWS account to another you have to destroy and re-create everything. This is a very difficult ask to put on people running applications
   in a production environment.___

7. In large-scale cloud environments, how do you approach balancing cost
optimization with performance and reliability, especially when using autoscaling
and distributed microservices architectures?

   JDT: ___At Thrivent, surprisingly cost has taken a bit of a back seat. We are just bleeding cloud cost while we try to get people to build new cloud apps hoping they can eventually recoup the cost. We are actively trying to 
   move apps out of our data centers into the cloud and dealing with the cost of that. We have a large distributed micorservices set up (OpenShift) that is used heavily but I know very little about it.___

8. How do you see the shift toward hybrid and multi-cloud environments impacting
how companies design and manage their infrastructure over the next few years?

   JDT: ___I personally do not like the idea of multi-cloud (deploying to more than one major cloud vendor) and I think it is probably still reserved for all but the largest companies as I think multi-region is probably enough 
   redunancy for all but the most critical of needs. Thrivent is currently single region in AWS, and we have been ok with that though the us-east-1 outtage a few weeks ago has people questioning this.___

9. What do you think companies struggle with when they decide to move to the
cloud, and how can they best prepare to overcome them?

   JDT: ___Lack of experience and expertise is a barrier, you want to have a very solid account structure set up before you start moving to the cloud and that takes time and validation before you can get going. At a large org 
   you will need to work with many non-IT departments such as Information Security, Legal, etc. to make sure everything is set up. You will want to have a centrally managed cloud structure vs. letting employees use their personal
   credit cards to set up new accounts for their org (this has happened!) so there is a lot of hurdles to jump thru, but no more than standing up a new data center I think.___
